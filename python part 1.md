## What is Python?
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular languages for beginners and experts alike, especially in fields like data science, machine learning, web development, automation, and more.

## Key Features of Python
- **Readable and Easy-to-Learn Syntax:** Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and human-readable, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners.
- **Versatile and Powerful:** Python can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development and data analysis to machine learning and scientific computing.
- **Extensive Libraries and Frameworks:** Python boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify and accelerate development. For data science, libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are invaluable.
- **Strong Community Support:** Python has a large, active community that contributes to its extensive documentation, forums, and tutorials.

## Installing Python and Setting Up the Development Environment
To start programming in Python, you need to install the Python interpreter and set up a suitable development environment. Here’s how to do it:

### 1. Download and Install Python
- Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python.
- Follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) to install Python.
- Ensure that you check the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation on Windows.

### 2. Verify the Installation
- Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
- Type `python --version` or `python3 --version` and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version number.

### 3. Install a Code Editor or IDE
While you can write Python code in any text editor, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can enhance your productivity. Popular choices include:
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A lightweight, powerful code editor with numerous extensions.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Use Jupyter Notebook on VS Code because it's versatile and user-friendly. You will find a complete guide on how to install VS Code and how to use Jupyter Notebook in VS Code in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1sAzPojKMg).

## Running Your First Python Program
With Python installed and your development environment set up, it’s time to write and run your first Python program.

### 1. Open Your Code Editor
Open your chosen code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook).

### 2. Write Your First Python Script
Create a new file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`. In your new file, write the following code:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### 3. Run Your Python Script
Save your file and run the script. How you run the script depends on your setup:
- **IDE:** Most IDEs have a run button or similar feature to execute your script directly.

### 4. View the Output
You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed in your command prompt, terminal, or IDE console. Congratulations! You’ve just run your first Python program.
